## 🎯 CONTENT REQUIREMENTS

### Exercise Design Principles:

#### 1. **Difficulty Distribution**
- **3 moderate exercises** (0.8-1.0 points each): Direct application of basic concepts
- **5 intermediate exercises** (1.0-1.3 points each): Require multiple steps or concept combination
- **2 challenging exercises** (1.5 points each): Complex problem-solving with reverse reasoning

#### 2. **Cognitive Diversity**
Include exercises that require:
- **Direct recall/application**: Apply formulas or definitions directly
- **Procedural fluency**: Execute algorithms and calculations
- **Conceptual understanding**: Explain why something works
- **Problem-solving**: Analyze, deduce, and discover from incomplete information
- **Reverse reasoning**: Work backwards from results to find initial conditions
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify relationships and structures

#### 3. **Representation Variety**
Use multiple formats:
- Explicit numerical/algebraic expressions
- Verbal descriptions requiring translation to math
- Visual representations (diagrams, tables, graphs, ASCII art)
- Real-world contexts and applied problems (shopping, sports, cooking, travel, etc.)
- Abstract mathematical scenarios
- Include at least 2-3 exercises with practical real-world contexts

#### 4. **Conceptual Traps (Subtle, Not Obvious)**
Include challenges that require careful analysis:
- Edge cases and special situations
- Conditions that appear to contradict but don't
- Numbers/elements that almost meet criteria but fail on one detail
- Common misconceptions that need to be addressed
- Distinctions between similar concepts

#### 5. **Technical Requirements**
- Each exercise must have **unique and elegant solution**
- Use correct mathematical notation from the theory
- Must NOT be trivial or solvable by simple inspection
- Include full justification in solutions
- Ensure exercises test different aspects of the theory
- Align with learning objectives from the theory document
- Include practical/real-world problems to show relevance (at least 2-3)
- Keep solutions focused - add tips/tricks only when they genuinely help (avoid unnecessary fluff)
