# 🟦 GENERAL EXAM GENERATOR PROMPT

## 📋 FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

### File 1: exercises.md
- **Exam format:** each exercise with clear point value (e.g.: "(1.5 points)", "(2 points)")
- **Point distribution:** total must add up to 10 points
- **Space for answers:** after each question, include blank lines or clearly marked sections where the student can write
- **No solutions:** this file only contains problem statements
- **Header:** Include space for student name and date

### File 2: solutions.md
- **Same order:** exercises numbered the same as file 1
- **Complete development:** each solution with step-by-step justification
- **Detailed explanations:** include reasoning and intermediate calculations
- **Mathematical rigor:** use proper notation and terminology from the theory
- **Include tips when relevant:** Add brief memory tricks or shortcuts ("Truc:", "Drecera:") - max 1 line
- **Add context:** When appropriate, mention practical applications or interesting facts - keep concise

## 🎯 CONTENT REQUIREMENTS

### Exercise Design Principles:

#### 1. **Difficulty Distribution**
- **3 moderate exercises** (0.8-1.0 points each): Direct application of basic concepts
- **5 intermediate exercises** (1.0-1.3 points each): Require multiple steps or concept combination
- **2 challenging exercises** (1.5 points each): Complex problem-solving with reverse reasoning

#### 2. **Cognitive Diversity**
Include exercises that require:
- **Direct recall/application**: Apply formulas or definitions directly
- **Procedural fluency**: Execute algorithms and calculations
- **Conceptual understanding**: Explain why something works
- **Problem-solving**: Analyze, deduce, and discover from incomplete information
- **Reverse reasoning**: Work backwards from results to find initial conditions
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify relationships and structures

#### 3. **Representation Variety**
Use multiple formats:
- Explicit numerical/algebraic expressions
- Verbal descriptions requiring translation to math
- Visual representations (diagrams, tables, graphs, ASCII art)
- Real-world contexts and applied problems (shopping, sports, cooking, travel, etc.)
- Abstract mathematical scenarios
- Include at least 2-3 exercises with practical real-world contexts

#### 4. **Conceptual Traps (Subtle, Not Obvious)**
Include challenges that require careful analysis:
- Edge cases and special situations
- Conditions that appear to contradict but don't
- Numbers/elements that almost meet criteria but fail on one detail
- Common misconceptions that need to be addressed
- Distinctions between similar concepts

#### 5. **Technical Requirements**
- Each exercise must have **unique and elegant solution**
- Use correct mathematical notation from the theory
- Must NOT be trivial or solvable by simple inspection
- Include full justification in solutions
- Ensure exercises test different aspects of the theory
- Align with learning objectives from the theory document
- Include practical/real-world problems to show relevance (at least 2-3)
- Keep solutions focused - add tips/tricks only when they genuinely help (avoid unnecessary fluff)
