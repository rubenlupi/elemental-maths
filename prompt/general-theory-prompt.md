# 🟦 GENERAL THEORY GENERATOR PROMPT

**LANGUAGE:** Generate all content in **CATALAN**.

## 📋 THEORY STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

### For Each Concept Include:

#### 1. **Clear Definition**
- Start with a precise, understandable definition
- Use bold for key terms
- Keep language appropriate to the target level

#### 2. **Multiple Examples**
- Provide at least 2-3 concrete examples
- Use diverse scenarios (numbers, real-world contexts, visual representations)
- Progress from simple to more complex
- Show both what IS and what IS NOT the concept (counterexamples)

#### 3. **Mathematical Notation**
- Introduce symbols clearly with explanation
- Show notation in context with examples
- Use consistent notation throughout
- Provide both symbolic and verbal forms

#### 4. **Visual Representations** (when applicable)
- ASCII diagrams
- Number lines
- Tables
- Venn diagrams
- Step-by-step illustrations

#### 5. **Key Properties or Rules**
- List important properties, rules, or patterns
- Explain WHY they work (intuitive reasoning)
- Highlight special cases or exceptions

#### 6. **Common Misconceptions** (when relevant)
- Address typical errors or confusions
- Clarify distinctions between similar concepts
- Provide notes to prevent misunderstandings

#### 7. **Connections to Other Concepts**
- Show relationships to previously learned material
- Indicate how this concept will be used later
- Build conceptual bridges

#### 8. **Practical Applications & Memory Tricks**
- Include 1-2 real-world applications (keep brief, 1-2 sentences)
- Add memory tricks or mnemonics when helpful ("Truc:", "Recorda:")
- Share interesting anecdotes or curiosities ("Curiositat:", "Sabies que...?")
- Keep each addition concise (max 2-3 lines) to avoid lengthy content

## 🎯 CONTENT REQUIREMENTS

### Language and Clarity:
- **Simple and precise**: Avoid jargon unless necessary; define technical terms
- **Active voice**: "We use this to..." rather than "This is used to..."
- **Conversational yet rigorous**: Friendly tone while maintaining mathematical accuracy
- **Age-appropriate**: Adjust complexity to target level

### Pedagogical Principles:
- **Concrete to abstract**: Start with tangible examples before formal definitions
- **Incremental complexity**: Build understanding step by step
- **Multiple modalities**: Text, symbols, visuals, examples
- **Why before how**: Explain reasoning and intuition, not just procedures
- **Engage with context**: Add brief real-world applications, memory tricks, and fun facts
- **Keep it concise**: Every addition should be purposeful and brief (avoid lengthy tangents)
- **Engage with context**: Add brief real-world applications, memory tricks, and fun facts
- **Keep it concise**: Every addition should be purposeful and brief (avoid lengthy tangents)

### Mathematical Rigor:
- **Precise definitions**: Use standard mathematical terminology
- **Correct notation**: Follow conventional mathematical symbols
- **Complete explanations**: Don't skip logical steps
- **Verify examples**: Ensure all calculations and examples are correct

### Formatting Standards:
- Use **bold** for key terms and definitions
- Use `code formatting` for numbers, sets, and inline math expressions
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use proper hierarchy (##, ###) for sections
- Include emoji icons (🔹) for visual organization
- Leave blank lines between sections for readability
